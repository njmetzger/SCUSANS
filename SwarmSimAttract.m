%SwarmSimAttract Attract behavior for Swarm_Adaptive_Navigation_Simulator.slx
%   LATEST UPDATE: 08/30/2018 by NJM 
% This attract behavior is called by the Robot # behavior blocks in
%   Swarm_Adaptive_Naviagtion_Simulator/Attract blocks. The attract behavior
%   causes the robots to clump together. It is set for constant velocity
%   and for constant force. For example, robots feel same attractive force
%   to each other when they are 10 units away or 1 unit away. Attraction is
%   based on average angle between "self" and other robots that are within
%   Sensor Range.

N= floor(length(RobotParams)/4);
